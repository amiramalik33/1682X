Example of a technical memo
document the basis of some design decision they were involved in
	be pretentious, latex it.
defome the design issue
identify concerns or reqs which drove the design
document the design
provide technical justification for it
**DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A DONE DECISION! CAN BE A WORK-IN-PROGRESS DECISION

Hourglass:
Start & end report with broad scope; middle is very narrow scope ("granular level" ha!)
end with next steps, what this informs, connect to high-level objectives

**design memo has to be VERY extra!!!!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?
*don't say "we're waiting for this number" make an assumption and then call out that its an WAG

Already known is that you're on team water and what the project is. Presenting subscale to Kyle C.

**give decision in intro! like an abstract

have a plot and note on the graph where the design is! with a star or whatevers
