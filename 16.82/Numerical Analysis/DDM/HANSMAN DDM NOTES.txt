Takeoff:
	Need pylon design to close the simulation
	pick accel, then you get force needed, make sure accel gets to takeoff in 500'
	
Wing Satisficity;
	What is the scope?
	just decide it (AR is just my decision)
	wing variables sensitivities if you want
Initial Sizing: Chapter 3, page 65

Takeoff Perf: chapter 17 page 791

TIP OFFSET IS 1/4 CHORD SAME BECAUSE SPAR

HMI:
	Not a lot of technical depth other than weight studies, is that enough?
	Decide electric vs mechanical
	Detailed, where's legs, where is the stand?
	Seat? (historesis foam (soft, but hard on impact)
	Label stuff on EPFD
	seat hard connected to hull/bulkhead
		and is on floor
		other applications of the foam, how thick did they use? (1" likely)
		acceleration of human through the foam (accel is infinite if no foam)
	throttle, stick, all on floor, etc.
	what percentile human?
	spectra composite cables (other materials)
	cg human on plane
	pull/pull going to rod

FIGURE OF MERIT
	battery energy vs weight, and get energy required from takeoff case (?)
