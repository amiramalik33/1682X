vxvy sweep:

make sure correct cl/cd/alpha values are in p before starting sim


to find a speed at a particular cl/cd/alpha, run a x-axis FE to find when D=F, then that's the speed for that value (wait but does this actually work tho??)

or... find drag at each speed and make sure it is less than FT..? probably this one
