"Mike Fury" at NASA doing eVTOL stuff? Human Systems Integration

Auto G-CAS (F-16 system that prevents over-g'ing)
	now on every fighter in USAF (not A-10 lol)
	Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System
SVO: Simplified Vehicle Optimization
MCA: Multicapable Airman
	18 rotors don't need 18 throttles: make simplified controls
electric aircraft = endorsement like tailwheel
heat-soaked battery at end of sortie but then have to go-around can exceed a temp limit
Airmen certification standards: public can comment on this new variation (endorsement vs rating)


How do you see the FAA's role in advancing these new technologies? You mentioned battery degredation, increased risk, so how can the FAA make those problems easier to solve?
