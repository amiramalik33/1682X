A few conceptual errors/inconsistencies (e.g., "this airfoil is a good glider airfoil, hence this airplane is a good glider" - need to justify more)


--What SHOULD I have said? This feedback is a microcosm of the type of questions I'll be asking myself as I prepare for the CDR, so I want to know exactly what you guys are looking for that makes me into that best type of presenter. (also that statement was not brought up as a question or challenge during the CoDR, so could the course staff, if they have questions, ask those questions?)

->for the team grade, it was apparently one of the best defended, technically, so what, did the aero side of the slides not work as well? Also, I did more work than just what I presented.

there's an implicit implication in this class that what you present is what you did, and I really am not a fan of this for the CoDR or PDR
