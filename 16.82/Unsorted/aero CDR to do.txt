FROM SYLLABUS:
CDR is to review the relatively detailed design, and uncover 
any areas of difficulty or uncertainty needing further attention. This review should be 
similar to the PDR with more specificity. It should start with a summary of the 
market opportunity (ie business pitch) and the driving requirements and include the 
detailed design of key components to be built, consideration of fabrication processes, 
and refined performance and mass estimates. It should include a proposed plan for 
next stage prototyping and testing to demonstrate the vehicle concept or reduce 
technical risk

PDR dry run notes:
Team Water:
Assume this is the first time audience is seeing this
Explain the airplane configuration (or maybe josh does it in aircraft dimensions)
should have waterline
nice graphic of takeoff
put specific aero requirements for the wing
	cruise speed, t/o req, etc.
drag equation:
	f-dot v equals power
	get wing area from weight
	assume L/D
	now have drag: give to power team, who'll then get power from our drag
Re-do percentage of fuselage below water line based on fuselage volume/area
re-do slides progression
	get rid of cylinder approximation for the upper bound: just use T/O calc upper bound
everything now is a backup slide and make nice new slides
"stuck on the water" is the right side of the matlab graph
Risks are too much drag (period).
	We're not looking at planing (drags in different modes)
**do an estimate of drag, a good one, to see if it works

****DESIGN COURSE, NOT AN ANALYSIS COURSE
	this is our design, this is how we'd do the analysis and we haven't done it
		^^this is an acceptable answer!!!!
go point-by-point on airplane configuration
show overall balance/cg
inertia model using cylinders? (probably better to use XFLR5)
dihedral!!

show cd vs cl, polars, etc. max cd SHOW POLARS

XFOIL deflection is good to have (JAX!) (Cp graph)


PDR notes:
Add CG slide & numbers for tail volumes, areas, etc.
with “cartoon” or boxes/cg’s of major objects
Better looking graphs (borders for the graph?)
Half of team aero’s stuff is controls (angles, etc.)
Cp graph
The tail shall… (for each part of the configuration) (“driving constraints”)
Do a tree of requirements! That’s the overall theme of the slides
And then what it is, finally
Drawing needs to be more accurate/consistent
5° fuselage angle
8° tail angle
Tail volume increase in sketch
Dihedral
More consistent hull outline
T-tail gets rid of two intersections over a cruciform → less drag
Dubious claim but he’s from boeing so i guess fine
Drag polar needs (0,0) point on plot
State assumptions of analysis & that it comes from XFLR5
Put up front how the drag is calculated for takeoff and hydrodynamics
Pylons = “sponsons”??
Pylons may likely be larger (all cartoons so far)
The purpose of this is to show what we did, like the calculations
Discussion on risk of B calculations:
Refine drag estimates due to 1.5x range on drag buildup but B sensitive to ~1% changes
Upper lower bound of drag, so upper lower bound of B
Drag at takeoff is major risk, not L/D at cruise
Check tail volume with typical ultralight seaplanes
Tail volume is correct, it’s the associated variable with tail volume that’s off
Takeoff Point & Cruise Point are separate requirements
T/O is the problem point right now
Doesn’t believe in T/O numbers

STOL CDR:
Go point by point the configuration and what drove it
Overall dimensions slide: literally every dimension
Exact mission profile (like aurora)
	distance & speed & cl & etc for t/o, climb, cruise, approach, land, reserves
	reserves is a line after landing in mission profile (slide 22 of STOL CDR)
	& performance metrics (slide 97-106 STOL CDR)
full slide on just modelling software & associated assumptions (s25-30 & 120-121 of STOL CDR)
	use math-y free body diagrams to show what variables being used
How got to dynamics conclusions (eg t/o distance) (s33+ STOL CDR)
overall aircraft diagram with all systems inside of it with cg in all 3 views
cockpit control (slide 76-77 STOL CDR)
Failure modes! their risk probability and mitigations (xwing THAs..?)
	more relevant to other teams, but could be for aero

Solar CDR:
Not an aero slide but presented by aero: dimensional slide w/where stuff is (no weights)
problem formulation (slide 16) minimize x w/r/t x subject to x, but for aero analysis
name what we're optimizing to and how we're doing it (17-21)
2D & 3D models kepot somewhat vague (23&24)
different airfoils for root & tip?
**FOCUS ON DESIGN, THEN OPTIMIZATION for work to do
GET ASWING!!! SHOULD BE FUN!
landing dynamics seem easy to calculate (57 & 58)
