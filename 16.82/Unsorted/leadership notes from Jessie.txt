"I want u guys to work more" is not helpful
Biggest challenge for team is not working together and not a design everybody understands
next week doing a unit on integration and communication
	use their vocab to say "this is what we're supposed to be doing"
give people a task to do, then they'll come
Tuesday: Drela or Peter will draw our plane with full dimensions
	make progress before then

I SHOULD PRESENT IN CDR
if the CDR lifts up from PDR, then it will be weighed higher
technical memo (can meet w/Jessie to see how to put that together)
not only factor is team grade (can be a split between individual & team grade)
demonstrate that I see problems in team and I'm trying my best to make it work
ask Drela or Hansman: "Here is what I am, what more should I do to make this team work better?"

Tell Team:
	Teams should be bringing in as much diagram stuff as they can for dimensions

JOSH:
Go to him and say some concerns you have (we should be doing xyz) someone needs to do this, I know you have other stuff on your plate, I can take this over
	**CAD-Keeper
our team isn't coming together, how would we solve this?
this work needs to be done, don't want to give it to you, so I'll do it

"Lets take the weekend off!"
Sunday at 1: everyone is free, let's get our configuration together

give a list of deliverables from CDRs

ask staff: what is in the design memo and how much work from the class does it represent? Since team water needs to improve a lot, could we push the memo deadline later for more time to improve?

**the entire staff was concerned about leadership and said I should do it


my "wisdom": unlike the real world, there is neither the motivation nor the consequence associated with shirking work, and worse still, the rest of the team is penalized for that without any ability to compensate for the lack of work (since everyone else has limited time as well)
