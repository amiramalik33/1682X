Sensors need triply redundant b/c if just two sensors and one breaks, which one is right?
Flight controls just need 2 (actuators, surfaces, etc.)
FailSafe vs Fail Operational (turn back vs keep going)
	Fail Operational important for space shuttle b/c expensive to turn back

AC 25.1309-1A (currently being updated)
DO-178C

Extremely Improbable = 1x10^-9 (per mission, or per hour of operation)

ASTM 3230 are the new standards

space shuttle had to reboot computers mid flight for ascent vs orbit vs descent b/c not enough memory/computation
	had 4 computers
	had 2 software packages: if one failed, reboot to the other
		made by two different teams for redundancy

Blimp story: hansman's friend was pitch down 45deg in a blimp when fbw elevator control went out. Survived b/c blimp = airbag
