classic polar is T1 analysis, CL vs CD

fixed speed polar is T & CD vs V(m/s) at L=W

just do more angles & reynolds numbers

Power is Drag * velocity

input/output power is T & D versus speed


use AVL (can output csv)
	write an AVL "wrapper" (takes stuff in, uses AVL, puts stuff out)


static stability is just cg (cm alpha neg and cm beta positive)

dynamic stability is inertias (don't matter as much, just change frequency and modes but if they're stable, it's about CG, inertias just tell you how fast it'll oscillate)

planing hull cd is 0.025 @ 5 degrees
