Main Loop:
	All data is constantly being written to a shared data bus (array)

Second Loop:
	Read that array every tenth of a second (ie artificial delay), then write to the S/D card

*This solves the I2C devices possibly being on different times and/or updating at different times and protects against waiting for a sensor to write something
