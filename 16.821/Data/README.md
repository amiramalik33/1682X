The Data_Analysis has all of the AABV files for every test we did, as well as matlab files to process & visualize the data.

The Pitot_Calibration folder has all the log files and matlab script that found the calibration factors for the airspeed sensor from wind tunnel testing.

The Raw_to_AABV is an example of running the csv_converter python script that makes the nice interpolated and unified data set from the raw pixhawk files.
