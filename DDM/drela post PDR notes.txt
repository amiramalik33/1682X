Need a step in fuselage
Don't immediately curve fuselage behind it: seperation huge risk post-step
step is relatively small
Fuselage needs to balance forward of the step

Fuselage ends, then becomes boom is a good design
canopy = an airfoil (end is a trailing edge) 
but need bouyancy in the back
work out what the volume
easier to manufacture & cheaper
**really being pushed to do this, at every turn

AR horizontal tail should be 10-ish (30-40% higher AR than in CAD)

"TailDragger" but in water??? small water pylon at tail end

bigger prop = better efficiency and less power, but need more torque
	torque is what sizes weight for an electric motor
	prop efficiency vs weight (related to torque), then pick the maximum of that curve
	can make prop diameter, power for cruise, and weight of motor and pick maximum
	power for flight write-up has this
	at optimum, sensitivity is low by definition! so go up or down 10% is fine

tail heavy design, so wing probably pretty behind of person (move wing to fix CG)
battery should be close to seat and quite low (in crash, need load paths from heavy items)
wing spar interfaces with bulkhead in fuselage 
tail boom interfaces just below wing spar
cl/cd from 3D analysis from XFLR5 (maybe 3deg is better?)

just need no wingtip dragging on takeoff or water maneuver, that's it so small sponsons on wintip
sizing case: wind picking up on the wingtip or pilot stepping in?
if in water on takeoff: need fuselage shape: step, fancy, etc.
retractable sponson: retract for takeoff, deploy for water maneuvering
	if retractable: then make it an easy high displacement shape
only extend during taxi (takeoff and landing without them, just keep wings level)
sponson can extend from fuselage
retract mid-takeoff roll?

L/D = 17 is easily beaten: we can get up to 30!!
**for aero drag, use Cd, not D
Cd .033 is wayy to high
do a drag buildup from an airfoil revolution (axis symmetric bodies cd is a paper)
	paper on canvas!

recline the body more
estimate drag
multiply side area by pi, that's wetted area
motor pods! also a thing
struts, sponson pods also axisymmetric
