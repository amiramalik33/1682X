# MIT Flight Vehicle Design Capstone, 2022-2023
## Summary
All aerospace students at MIT take two capstones, one where you design a vehicle (16.82), and one where you build a version of it (16.821). This repository has all the code regarding optimization, simulation, and any other numerical analysis I did for the capstone, which was quite a bit!

You can find the Critical Design Review we prepared at the end of the design phase in the 16.82 folder.

You can find the Final Brief we prepared at the end of the build and design phase in the 16.821 folder.

In 16.82, we designed a 70' wingspan solar electric amphibious ultralight airplane, and in 16.821 we built a 1/4 scale prototype.

## 16.82
This class was the design phase, held in Fall 2022. I was the Chief Engineer as well as the lead of Aerodynamics. And, having the most experience in the class with designing and building aircraft, I helped in all other teams as well.

For this semester, I wrote a script to optimize the wing area of a solar electric airplane (large wing means more solar panels, which means more power available, but a large wing also means more power required).

Also for 16.82 is the simulation I wrote for a water take-off and climb to 50' to characterize our power requirements in the highest-power-required situation.

## 16.821
This class was the build phase, held in Spring 2023. I was again the Chief Engineer as lead of the Performance, Integration, Flight Test team. I was also the lead (and only member!) of the avionics team.

In 16.821, I expanded on the simulation I wrote in the previous semester by re-working it so that I can run sweeps of the simulation to find our vehicle's sensitivity to drag and thrust.

And on the avionics side, I wrote a data logger from scratch using arduino to record gps speeds, airspeed, multiple versions of altitude, and inertials.
