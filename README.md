# MIT Flight Vehicle Design Capstone, 2022-2023
## Summary
All aerospace students at MIT take two capstones, one where you design a vehicle, and one where you build a version of it. This repository has all the code regarding optimization, simulation, and any other numerical analysis I did for the capstone, which was quite a bit!

You can find the Critical Design Review we prepared at the end of the design phase [here](http://amiramalik.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CDR_truncated.pdf).

You can find the Final Brief we prepared at the end of the build and design phase here.

## 16.82
This class was the design phase, held in Fall 2022. I was the Chief Engineer as well as the lead of Aerodynamics. And, having the most experience in the class with designing and building aircraft, I helped in all other teams as well.

Specifically for 16.82, you'll see a MATLAB optimization script for finding the optimal wing area of a solar electric airplane (since large wing areas can generate a lot of energy via solar panels! but the larger it gets, the more energy is required to fly).

Also for 16.82 is the simulation I wrote for a water take-off and climb to 50' to characterize our power requirements in the highest-power-required situation.

And, there is the beginnings of a sweep for finding Vx, Vy, minimum sink speed, and other variables. This script is expanded upon in 16.821

## 16.821
This class was the build phase, held in Spring 2023. I was again the Chief Engineer as lead of the Performance, Integration, Flight Test team. I was also the lead (and only member!) of the avionics team.

In 16.821, I expanded on the simulation I wrote in the previous semester and wrote an I2C data logger for the aircraft's avionics.
